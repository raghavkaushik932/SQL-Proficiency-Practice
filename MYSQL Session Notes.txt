File Management System
-----------------------
Information / data stored in file.
MS Excel

What is a Database ?

The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. 
It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.

C - Create
R- Read
U - Update
D - Delete


Example : The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.

Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.

Types Of Database
-----------------
1) DBMS ( Database management System) Dbase, Foxpro 
2) RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - MySQL, SQL Serever, DB2, Oracle, MS-Access..

SQL (Structure Query Language)- used to communicate with the database to perform different kinds of operations.

Components of Database
----------------------
1) Server - actual data is stored
2) Client - used to perform operations on databse server

Types of client
---------------
Graphical user Interface client
Command line client

MySQL Clients
-------------
MySQL Workbench (GUI Client)
MySQL Shell (CLI Client)
Toad
Squirell

Install MySQL

1) Working on MySQL Workbench & Command prompt client
2) SQL Commands

Types of SQL Commands
-----------------------
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate , Rename
Commands are auto committed

2. DML (Data Manupulation Language)
Insert, Update, Delete
DML Commands are not auto commited means it cant permanetly save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

3. DCL (Data Control Language) (Administrative use)
Grant, Revoke

4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Commit , Rollback, Savepoint

5. DQL (Data Query Language)
Select

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXIST databasename;
CREATE SCHEMA databasename;

DROP DATABASE databaseName;
DROP SCHEMA databaseName;

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR(20), Email VARCHAR(100), DOB DATE);  
describe Student;


INSERT INTO Student values(1, "Prachi", 77);
INSERT INTO Student (SNO, SNAME, MARKS)values(1, "Prachi", 77);


----------
How to select Data from the table?
Select 

mysql -u root -p employees < employees.sql

set path=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin;

Error Code: 1075. Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key



SQL Datatypes
--------------
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

Numeric
Text
Date/Time


->WHERE CLAUSE
-------------
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


-----------

ORDER BY (For Sorting the rows in the result)

SELECT 
   select_list
FROM 
   table_name
ORDER BY 
   column1 [ASC|DESC], 
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;


MySQL DISTINCT clause  to remove duplicates from the result given by the SELECT clause.

SELECT DISTINCT
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE 
    search_condition
ORDER BY 
    sort_expression;


OPERATORS
---------
AND operator
It is used in the WHERE clause of the SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to form a condition.
The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


Or Operator

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

Ex1.

SELECT    
	customername, 
	country
FROM    
	customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR 
      country = 'France';

Ex2.

SELECT   
	customername, 
	country, 
	creditLimit
FROM   
	customers
WHERE(country = 'USA'
		OR country = 'France')
	  AND creditlimit > 100000;

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.


Not Operator
The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result

NOT LIKE
NOT BETWEEN
NOT IN
NOT GREATER THAN (>)
NOT LESS THAN (<)

IN Opertator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

-----------
DDL Commands


Primary Key
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table.  

Rules of Primary Key:

1) A primary key must contain unique values. If the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.

2 )A primary key column cannot have NULL values. Any attempt to insert or update NULL to primary key columns will result in an error. 
MySQL implicitly adds a NOT NULL constraint to primary key columns.

3) A table can have one an only one primary key.
DROP TABLE table_name;

DDL Commands (Auto committed)
---------------------------------
1) Create Table- Used for creating database objects like a database and a database table, views, Triggers etc.

2) Alter Table - Used for modifying and renaming elements of an existing database table. Add new column, Drop column, Modify existing column, Rename column 

3) Truncate Table- Used to remove all the records from a database table.
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE Condition; (DML, not auto committed)

4) Drop Table- Used for removing an entire database or a database table.
DROP TABLE table_name;

5) Rename Table- Used to change the name of the database table.

RENAME TABLE old_table _name To new_table_name; 

ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

2) Mathematical/Numeric functions
3) Date/Time Functions
4) Aggregate Function

1) Mathematical/Numeric functions
2) Date/Time Functions
3) Aggregate Function



-----------
Group By Clause
In MySQL GROUP BY clause is used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column.
Group by clause is often used with aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT.

Filter the records based on condition
----------------------------------------
Having Clause -  After Group By Clause

Where Clause -  before Group By Clause

Order By - to sort the records/result


Select Column-names
	From Table-name
		where condition
			Group By Column-names
				Having condition
					Order By Column-names



-------------------------SQL Queries----------------------------------------

create database project_hr;

select * from employees;

select department_id, count(*) from employees group by department_id;

select * from employees where department_id=5;

select department_id, sum(salary) from employees group by department_id;

select department_id, min(salary), max(Salary) from employees group by department_id;
select * from employees;


select job_id, department_id ,count(*) from employees group by job_id, department_id;
select job_id, count(*) from employees group by job_id having count(*) > 2;

select department_id, sum(salary) from employees group by department_id having sum(salary) > 20000;

select department_id, sum(salary) from employees where department_id <> 6  group by department_id having sum(salary) > 20000;

select * from employees order by salary desc;


select department_id, sum(salary) from employees group by department_id  order by sum(salary) desc;

select department_id, sum(salary) from employees 
	where department_id <> 6  
		group by department_id having sum(salary) > 20000 
			order by sum(salary) desc;




------------
Set Operators

1. Union - UNION operator combine two or more result sets from multiple SELECT statements into a single result set.

2. Union all - The UNION ALL command combines the result set of two or more SELECT statements (allowsduplicate values).

3. Intersect (INTERSECT was added in MySQL 8.0.31.) - compares the result sets of two queries and returns the common rows.
	Intersect ALL (allow duplicates)

4. Except (Minus) (EXCEPT was added in MySQL 8.0.31.)- allows you to retrieve rows from one query that do not appear in another query. EXCEPT operator find the set difference between two sets of data.



Rules
=====
The number of columns in all the SELECT statements must be the same.
The order of columns in all the SELECT statements must be the same.
The data types of the corresponding columns in both SELECT statements must be the same or similar or convertible/compatible.



CREATE TABLE A (
    col1 INT ,col2 INT 
);

CREATE TABLE B (
    col1 INT ,col2 INT 
);

CREATE TABLE C (
    col1 INT ,col2 INT 
);

INSERT INTO A VALUES (1,2),(2,3),(3,4);
INSERT INTO B VALUES (1,2),(1,3),(3,4);
INSERT INTO C VALUES (1,3),(1,3),(3,4);



CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id INT 
);

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    id INT 
);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2),(3),(4);

select * from t1;
select * from t2;

select * from t1
union 
select * from t2;

select * from t1
union all
select * from t2;

select concat(contactFirstName, contactLastName) As Fullname from customers
union
select concat(firstName,"", lastName) from employees;

select * from t1 
intersect
select * from t2;

-----------
JOINS
-----


JOINS are used with SELECT statement. It is used to retrieve data from multiple tables.
The tables are mutually related using primary and foreign keys.


TYPES OF JOINS
--------------

1) INNER JOIN / simple join  - Matched records.

SELECT
    select_list
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON join_condition1
INNER JOIN t3 ON join_condition2
...;

2) LEFT OUTER JOIN / LEFT JOIN - Matched records from both the tables + un matched records from left table.
SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    t1
LEFT JOIN t2 ON 
    join_condition;

3) RIGHT OUTER JOIN / RIGHT JOIN - Matched records from both the tables + un matched records from right table.
SELECT 
    select_list
FROM t1
RIGHT JOIN t2 ON 
    join_condition;

4) CROSS JOIN (or Cartesian join) - is used to generate a paired combination of each row of the first table with each row of the second table.

5) FULL JOIN - To retrieve all records from both tables, whether there is a match or not.
Not supported in MySQL.
use demodb;
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    num INT 
);

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    num INT 
);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (10),(11),(12),(14);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (11),(12),(13),(15);

select * from t1 inner join t2 on t1.num = t2.num;

use project_hr;
select * from employees inner join departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    textDescription
FROM
    products t1
INNER JOIN productlines t2
    ON t1.productline = t2.productline;

SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    textDescription
FROM
    products
INNER JOIN productlines
    using (productline);
 
 
 select * from t1 left join t2 on t1.num = t2.num;
 
 use classicmodels;
  SELECT
    customers.customerNumber,
    customerName,
    orderNumber,
    status
FROM
    customers 
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber
 WHERE
    orderNumber IS NULL;
    
 select * from t1 right join t2 on t1.num = t2.num;
 
 use demodb;
 SELECT * FROM T1 cross join T2

===========


Sub Queries

A MySQL subquery is a query nested within another query such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. 
Also, a subquery can be nested within another subquery.

A MySQL subquery is called an inner query while the query that contains the subquery is called an outer query.


The output of inner query becomes input of outer query

There are two types of sub queries;
1. Single row sub query (<=, >=, !=)
2. Multi row sub Query (IN, ANY, ALL)

select * from employees;
select * from employees where salary > 12000;
select salary from employees where first_name ='Michael';

-- select employees whose is greater than 'Michael's' salary
select * from employees where salary > (select salary from employees where first_name ='Michael');

-- the following query returns the customer who has the highest payment.
SELECT MAX(amount) FROM payments;
SELECT 
    customerNumber, 
    checkNumber, 
    amount
FROM
    payments
WHERE
    amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM payments);
    
    
    select * from employees;
    -- 2nd highest salary from employees table
select max(salary) from employees;

select max(salary) from employees where salary < (select max(salary) from employees);

-- List employees having highest salary
select  first_name from employees where salary =  (select max(salary) from employees);

  -- 3rd highest salary from employees table
select max(salary) from employees where salary <
	(select max(salary) from employees where salary <
		(select max(salary) from employees));


-- find the customers who have not placed any orders

SELECT DISTINCT
            customerNumber
        FROM
            orders;

SELECT 
    customerName
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    customerNumber NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT
            customerNumber
        FROM
            orders);
            
 -- query to get first name, lastname department id and department name    
select first_name, last_name, department_id, 
(select department_name from departments where employees.department_id = departments.department_id) departmentname  from employees;
