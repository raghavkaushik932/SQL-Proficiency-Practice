# SQL-Proficiency-Practice
"I have practiced the following SQL queries using MySQL Workbench to enhance my skills in database management and querying."
## Setup
Before executing the queries, ensure that we have set up the sample databases. We can do this by running the provided `CREATE` and `INSERT` statements. These statements are typically found in separate SQL files named `create_tables.sql` and `insert_data.sql`.

Once the databases are set up, you can use the queries provided in [SQL_Practice_Queries.txt](link-to-your-text-file) to practice SQL.

For detailed instructions on setting up the sample databases, refer to the comments within the `create_tables.sql` and `insert_data.sql` files.
