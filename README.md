# SQL-Proficiency-Practice
"I have practiced the following SQL queries using MySQL Workbench to enhance my skills in database management and querying."
## Setup
Before executing the queries, ensure that we have set up the sample databases. We can do this by running the provided `CREATE` and `INSERT` statements. These statements are typically found in separate SQL files named `create_tables.sql` and `insert_data.sql`.

Once the databases are set up, you can use the queries provided in '[SQL_PRACTICE_QUERIES_TXT_1.txt](https://github.com/raghavkaushik932/SQL-Proficiency-Practice/blob/main/SQL_PRACTICE_QUERIES_TXT_1.txt)'.to practice SQL.
